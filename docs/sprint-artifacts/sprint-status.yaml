# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created (via create-story)

# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then Dev runs code-review (fresh context, ideally different LLM)
