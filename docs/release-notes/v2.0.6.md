# v2.0.6 Release Notes

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

- **Updated Application Icon**: The application now uses a new high-resolution logo (`resources/gs-compressor-logo.png`).
  - Generated a complete `icon.icns` for macOS including all standard sizes (16x16 to 1024x1024).
  - Updated `icon.png` in both `build/` and `resources/` directories to ensure consistent branding across the development and packaged environments.

## 📦 Build & Configuration
